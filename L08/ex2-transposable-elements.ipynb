Note that a transpose is represented by 2 repeats that enclosed a region of DNA. Also take into consideration the special cases such as transpose intersection on transpose engulfing (that case in which a small transpose is positioned inside a bigger transposome).\n",

Also the insertion of the inverted repeats into a randomly generated DNA sequence dictates the known positions of our transposomes to understand what inverted repeats are use the presentation from Moodle in relation with transposomes."
